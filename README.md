# Institute-admission-manage-system
This C code appears to be a simple application for a course management system. Let's break down the functionalities and structure:

1. **Header Files**: The code includes standard header files like `<stdio.h>`, `<stdlib.h>`, and `<string.h>`.

2. **Function Prototypes**: Function prototypes are declared for functions like `appdet()`, `signup()`, `login()`, `stu_db()`, `loading()`, `pg_dip()`, `iot()`, `ai()`, `stu_co_db()`, and `detl()`. These functions seem to handle various aspects of user interaction, authentication, course details, and database operations.

3. **Global Variables**: Global variables like `lgs` (for login success flag), `mbno` (for mobile number), `username`, `payment`, and `coursename` are declared.

4. **Main Function**: The `main()` function is the entry point. It displays a menu for signup, login, and logout options. Based on user input, it calls corresponding functions.

5. **Signup and Login**: The `signup()` function allows users to register by providing a username and password. The `login()` function enables users to log in with their credentials. There's also an option for an admin login.

6. **Course Selection**: After successful login, users can select from different courses like PG Diploma in Embedded Systems, Internet of Things, and Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Each course has its own set of modules and fee details.

7. **Payment Handling**: Upon selecting a course, users are prompted to make a payment. If payment is successful, the status is updated. Otherwise, it remains unpaid.

8. **File Handling**: Data is stored and retrieved from CSV files for user registration, course details, and payments.

9. **Admin Functions**: Admin login allows viewing student and course databases, providing additional administrative control.

10. **Display Functions**: Functions like `stu_db()`, `stu_co_db()`, and `detl()` are responsible for displaying student and course details.

11. **Auxiliary Functions**: Functions like `loading()` simulate a loading animation, and `payment1()` handle payment processing.

12. **Error Handling**: Basic error handling is implemented for file operations and user input validation.

In summary, this code implements a basic course management system with user authentication, course selection, payment processing, and administrative functionalities.
